# NetLogo Models
Some WIP NetLogo models developed for my undergraduate thesis in Mechanical Engineering.

Included models are: 
- Particle based Venturi effect
- Solar radiation on solar panels
- physical distribution of items in a warehouse (lacks IA)
- Simple harmonic motion

Only the Heat Conduction model was included in the final paper. 
The model can be found here https://github.com/juliopw/TICT-Modelagem-Bifocal-NetLogo
